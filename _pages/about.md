Currently, I am a MPhil Student in The University of Hong Kong (HKU). My research topics focus on multi-robot cooperation, searching, especially in the totally unknown environment. Specifically, we hope to generate a group of intelligent agents finishing the Rescue and Search (RAS) using time and cost as less as possible under a diversity map set for generalization. Now I am working in this project as well as sim2real in turtlebots.

Here are some of ways you can reach me. I often take some time in chasing new technologies as well as sharing my research progress in [Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/88950631/). Besides, I also take [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/zhui-xun-ni-de-jiao-bu-56) as one of my learning platforms due to the diversity and activity of this community.
