        - title: "<b>Achievements:</b>"
          contents:
            - "Implemented high-precision mapping in a ten-thousand square meter environment with Cartographer."
            -  Optimized the back-end of Cartographer, reduced the constraints, lowered the computing demand on the onboard computer, and improved the localization accuracy and frequency.
            - Optimized the AMCL source code, added ICP matching, solved the problems of initial localization and low frequency of AMCL localization, and improved the positioning accuracy at the same time.

      year: 2021 - 2022
      description:
        - Started to explore multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) research to address the challenge of collaborative exploration in unknown environments in large-scale scenarios.
        - Optimized the Ant Colony Algorithm for solving the Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (MTSP) by constructing a non-complete graph.

    - title: Graduation Project
      institution: School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China
      year: 2020 - 2021
      description:
        - "<b>Title:</b> Multi-robot Collaborative Path Planning under Task and Space Time Constraints"
        - title: "<b>Achievements:</b>"
          contents:
            - Added time penalty term in the market mechanism law, and initialized the agent positions through clustering method, resulting in a 30% reduction in the time taken by the agents to complete the task.
            - Solved the problem of traffic congestion at intersections for multiple robots using a strategy similar to the push-box game by making full use of the idle paths to perform temporal and spatial planning of multiple robots, ensuring a high success rate during the planning process.
